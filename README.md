There roams a figure, shadow-clad, a hacker known as sn3aky-peaky, so bright.
With skillful hands upon the keys, and a mind that's sharp and keen,
They dance through firewalls with ease, unseen, unfelt, serenely clean.

A whisper in the wires, a ghost within the machine,

A digital explorer, on their own unique road.
